## VANILLA - KG Normalization

![KG Normalization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SDM-TIB/VANILLA/main/images/DesignPattern(a)VANILLA.png "KG Normalization")
## üîç Overview

The design pattern components of VANILLA for KG Normalization process. <br>
VANILLA demonstrates the use of symbolic rules in conjunction with symbolic constraint validation to
normalize the KGs and eliminate anomalies. <br>
Normalized KGs improve the predictive performance of numerical inductive learning approaches.

## üöÄ Running the Pipeline of KG Normalization

1. **Configure input**
   Modify `input.json` to select the benchmark KG and rule/constraint files.
```json
{
  "KG": "FrenchRoyalty",
  "prefix": "http://FrenchRoaylty.org/",
  "rules_file": "french_royalty.csv",
  "rdf_file": "french_royalty.nt",
  "constraints_folder": "FrenchRoaylty",
  "log_level": "INFO",
  "pca_threshold": 0.75
}
```
2. **Executing KG Normalization**

```python
python Symbolic_predictions.py
```

This will:
- Generate inferred predictions using symbolic rules.
- Validate them against SHACL constraints.
- Output:
  - Transformed KGs
  - Constraint validation reports in `Constraints/`
  - Predictions in `Predictions/`

## üß† Graphical Summary

The VANILLA framework integrates **symbolic rules**, **domain constraints** for knowledge graph normalization. <br>
