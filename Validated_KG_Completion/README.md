# VANILLA: Validated Knowledge Graph Completion - A Normalization-based Framework for Integrity, Link Prediction, and Logical Accuracy

![Graphical Abstract](images/DesignPattern(b)-VANILLA.png)
## üîç Overview


## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

3. **Configure input**
   Modify `input.json` to select the benchmark KG and rule/constraint files.

---

## üöÄ Running the Pipeline

### 1. Symbolic Predictions & Constraint Validation
Run the script to generate predictions and validate them:
```bash
python Symbolic_predictions.py
```
This will:
- Generate inferred predictions using logical rules.
- Validate them against SHACL constraints.
- Output:
  - Transformed KGs
  - Constraint validation reports in `Constraints/`
  - Predictions in `Predictions/`
---

## üìà Evaluation Metrics

We evaluate KG completion using embedding models:
- **TransE**, **TransH**, **TransD**
- **RotatE**, **ComplEx**, **TuckER**
- **CompGCN**

Metrics reported:
- Hits@1, Hits@3, Hits@5, Hits@10
- Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)

## üß† Graphical Summary

The VANILLA framework integrates **symbolic rules**, **domain constraints**, and **neural embeddings** for high-quality knowledge graph completion. It identifies valid and invalid triples using evolving logical constraints and employs numerical models to infer missing links, ensuring semantic consistency and logical soundness in the normalized KG.
